Thank you for providing your membership ID. You are a member with a Basic tier.

Could you please provide the details of the incident for the claim? Please include the following information in your description:

1. Is it a network hospital or not?
2. Details about the accident or incident (e.g., was it an accident or suicide).
3. When did the accident happen, and how many days have passed since the accident?

I had to get emergency surgery for appendicitis. Thankfully, my policy was active, and I’d been keeping up with the premiums, plus the surgery itself was covered under my plan. I made sure to submit all the required documents, like the hospital bills and discharge summary. My total claim went over the ₹12,000, and apparently, the room I stayed in was  ₹5,000 per day. On top of that, I didn’t get pre-authorization for the surgery, which they said was needed for planned procedures.
